hello! 

Welcome to my project! This is my first ever project using Terraform and other cloud technologies. Below you can find a list of them: 

Terraform: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool for provisioning.
Docker: Containerization platform for app deployment.
Hetzner Cloud: Cloud infrastructure provider.
AWS: Cloud services platform.
Ansible: Automation tool for configuration management.
Ubuntu: Linux operating system.
Apache: Web server software.

First following along with a tutorial, I was able to create the foundations for an automated deployment of infrastructure using the following technologies. 
I also implemented keys that help to secure the deployment and the use of Cloud services such as AWS and Hetzner. 
After securing the position of Hetzner in the Terraform infrastructure I moved on to using Ansible to devlop the automation toll for configuration. I was able to add in a couple roles, such as apache2, docker and ubuntu. 
Which led them to building containers through the Docker role. 

This project took the better half of a month and a half to learn and install and have running! I had the best time learning about cloud and can't wait to deepen my skills! 

Try your hand at creating your own automated deploment by cloning this repository! I would love to hear any feedback needed!
